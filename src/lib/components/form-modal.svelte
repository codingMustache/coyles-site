	<strong> If you do not receive a response about your tattoo request </strong>
</p>
<p>
	This means our I have reviewed your request and decided not to take it on. This could be for any
	number of reasons such as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is not something I feel comfortable with or interested in doing.</li>
	<li>
		I have been taking on a lot of similar projects and want to keep the work they take on
		diversified.
	</li>
	<li>I are not accepting new appointments at this time</li>
</ul>
